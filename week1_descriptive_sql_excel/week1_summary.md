# ðŸ“Š Week 1 Summary â€“ Data Analyst 30-Day Refresh Plan

## ðŸ—“ Overview
Week 1 focused on **Descriptive Analytics** using Excel and SQL.  
The goal was to refresh core analytical skills: statistics, pivot tables, SQL querying, filtering, and hypothesis testing.

---

## âœ… Activities Completed
- **Day 1:** Excel basics (Mean, Median, Std Dev).  
- **Day 2:** Pivot Tables & Visualizations (Category, Region, Segment).  
- **Day 3:** SQL Basics (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY).  
- **Day 4:** SQL Filtering (BETWEEN, LIKE, IN, HAVING).  
- **Day 5:** Statistics in SQL (descriptive stats, correlation, outlier detection).  
- **Day 6:** Hypothesis Testing in SQL (Welchâ€™s t-test, Chi-square, Two-proportion z-test).  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- **Sales Distribution** â†’ Skewed: many small orders, few very large outliers (> $20k).  
- **Regional Performance** â†’ West leads in sales, South underperforms.  
- **Segment Performance** â†’ Consumer drives revenue, Home Office delivers higher profit per order.  
- **Profitability** â†’ Inconsistent; discounts cause negative profit orders.  
- **Yearly Stability** â†’ No significant difference in mean sales between 2015 and 2016.  
- **Segment Ã— Region** â†’ No significant association; segments are evenly spread across regions.  
- **Loss Rates** â†’ Similar for Consumer (19.3%) and Corporate (18.4%); not statistically different.

## âœ¨ Insights
1. Outliers must be tracked separately, otherwise averages are misleading.  
2. Revenue â‰  Profit â†’ large sales can still mean losses if discounts are high.  
3. Strategy should balance **Consumer volume** with **Home Office profitability**.  
4. Segment and regional strategies can be unified, since no strong statistical differences exist.

## ðŸ“Œ Deliverables
- **Excel** â†’ Basic stats & Pivot Tables (`Day1-2_Excel_Analysis.xlsx`).  
- **SQL** â†’ Scripts for queries & tests (`day03_sql_basics.sql`, `day04_sql_filters.sql`, `day05_sql_stats.sql`, `day06_sql_hypothesis_testing.sql`).  
- **Reports** â†’ Daily reports (Day 1â€“6) + this weekly summary.  

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Week 2)
- **Day 8â€“9:** SQL Joins & Data Modeling.  
- **Day 10â€“12:** Advanced SQL (Window Functions, Ranking, Running Totals).  
- **Day 13â€“14:** Python for Data Analysis (Pandas basics).
